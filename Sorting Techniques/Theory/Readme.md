# Sorting Techniques

Arranging the elements of array in a particular order(ascending or descending).

This folder contains theoretical explanations and code examples related to sorting techniques.

## Theory

### Sorting Techniques
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swap two adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Find the minimum element in unsorted array and swap it with element at beginning.
- **Insertion Sort**: Insert the element from unsorted array to its correct position in sorted array .

## Code Examples

Here are some example codes demonstrating the use of different sorting techniques:

- [Bubble Sort Example](../code/BubbleSort.cpp)
- [Selection Sort Example](../code/SelectionSort.cpp)
- [Insertion Sort Example](../code/InsertionSort.cpp)
