An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that stores a collection of elements, all of which are of the same type, in a contiguous block of memory. Each element can be accessed directly by its index, which is an integer representing its position within the array. 
#Arrays are used in a variety of applications, such as:

Storing multiple values: Arrays allow you to store and manage a collection of data.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Many algorithms for sorting (like bubble sort, quick sort) and searching (like binary search) operate on arrays.
Matrix Representation: Arrays can be used to represent matrices and perform operations on them.
Dynamic Programming: Arrays are frequently used to store intermediate results in dynamic programming.
Limitations
While arrays are simple and efficient, they do have some limitations:

Fixed Size: The size of an array must be defined at compile time and cannot be changed.
Contiguous Memory: Arrays require a block of contiguous memory, which may not always be available, especially for large arrays.

## Code Examples

Here are some example codes demonstrating the use of arrays:

- [Array Example 1](../code/array_example1.cpp)
- [Array Example 2](../code/array_example2.cpp)
